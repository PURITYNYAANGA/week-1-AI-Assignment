# CryptoAdvisor Chatbot

**Version:** 1.0.0

## ü§ñ About CryptoAdvisor

CryptoAdvisor is a simple, rule-based chatbot built in Python. It's designed to analyze a predefined dataset of cryptocurrency information and provide investment suggestions based on two main criteria:

1.  **Profitability:** Considers factors like price trends and market capitalization.
2.  **Sustainability:** Evaluates aspects like energy consumption and a project's sustainability score.

The chatbot engages users in a conversational manner, aiming to guide them towards cryptocurrencies that are potentially "green and growing."

**Disclaimer:** *CryptoAdvisor provides suggestions based on its predefined dataset and rules. It is for informational and educational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky. Always conduct your own thorough research (DYOR) before making any investment decisions.*

## ‚ú® Features

* **Conversational Interface:** Interacts with users through a command-line interface.
* **Predefined Crypto Data:** Uses a built-in dictionary (`crypto_db`) containing information about several cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, Polkadot, and a fictional EcoCoin).
    * Data points for each coin include: `price_trend`, `market_cap`, `energy_use`, `sustainability_score`, and a brief `description`.
* **Rule-Based Recommendations:**
    * **Profitability:** Suggests coins that are "rising" in price and have a "high" or "medium" market cap.
    * **Sustainability:** Recommends coins with "low" or "very low" energy use and a sustainability score above 7/10.
    * **Long-Term Growth:** Provides suggestions based on a combined score that balances price trends (rising/stable) and sustainability metrics (score >= 6/10, not high energy use).
* **Specific Queries:**
    * Ask about coins that are "trending up."
    * Inquire about the "most sustainable" or "eco-friendly" coins.
    * Seek advice on coins for "profitability" or to "make money."
    * Ask for recommendations for "long-term growth."
    * Request "details for [coin name]" (e.g., "details for Bitcoin").
    * Ask the bot to "list all" coins it knows.
* **Chatbot Personality:**
    * **Name:** CryptoAdvisor
    * **Tone:** Friendly and informative (e.g., "Hey there! I'm CryptoAdvisor. Let‚Äôs find you a green and growing crypto! üåøüìà")
