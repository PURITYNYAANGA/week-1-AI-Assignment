CryptoAdvisor is a Python-based, rule-based chatbot designed to offer cryptocurrency investment suggestions. It analyzes a predefined dataset of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, Polkadot, and a fictional EcoCoin) based on two key criteria: profitability (price trends, market capitalization) and sustainability (energy consumption, sustainability score).

The chatbot features a conversational command-line interface and provides recommendations for "green and growing" cryptocurrencies. It can answer specific queries like trending coins, most sustainable options, profitability advice, and long-term growth recommendations, as well as provide detailed information for any listed coin.

Key features include:

Predefined Data: Uses an internal crypto_db with details like price trend, market cap, energy use, and sustainability score.
Rule-Based Recommendations: Offers suggestions based on defined rules for profitability (rising price, high/medium market cap), sustainability (low/very low energy use, high sustainability score), and long-term growth (balanced metrics).
Informative and Friendly Tone: Engages users with a helpful and clear demeanor, always reminding them of the inherent risks of crypto investments and the importance of conducting their own research (DYOR).
To use CryptoAdvisor, simply save the provided Python code, navigate to its directory in a terminal, and run it with python crypto_advisor.py. The chatbot will then be ready to answer your queries.
